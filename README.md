# quantcalloptionpricecalculation
This code calculates the price of a European call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton model, given specific option parameters and market data.

Steps:

1. Import necessary libraries: The code begins by importing the required libraries, including QuantLib for quantitative finance, pandas for data manipulation, and numpy for numerical operations.

2. Define option parameters: Various option parameters are set, such as option type (Call), underlying asset's current price, strike price, time to maturity, volatility, and risk-free interest rate.

3. Define today's date: The current date, May 15, 2023, is defined as "today."

4. Calculate the option's expiration date: The code calculates the option's expiration date by adding the specified number of days (365 days multiplied by the time to maturity) to the current date.

5. Create the option object: An instance of a European option is created with the specified parameters, including the option type and expiration date.

6. Create the Black-Scholes-Merton model: Handles are created for the underlying asset price, risk-free interest rate, dividend rate (assumed to be 0 in this case), and volatility surface. These handles are used to construct the Black-Scholes-Merton model.

7. Create the Black-Scholes-Merton process: The Black-Scholes-Merton process is constructed using the handles for the underlying asset, interest rate, dividend rate, and volatility surface.

8. Calculate the option price: The code uses the Analytic European Engine to calculate the option price based on the Black-Scholes-Merton model.

9. Print the calculated option price: The final option price (Net Present Value) is printed to the console.

In summary, this code calculates the price of a European call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton model, given specific option parameters and market data.
